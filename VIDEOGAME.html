<p> Just as every other kid nowadays even I like playing games a lot, however I am not addicted to them a lot
    I just play for fun whenever I can and also not really addicted to gaming. Whenever I am really stressed I
    play games so that I can get my mind of the things that are stressing me out. </p>
